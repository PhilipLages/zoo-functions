# Project Zoo Functions

For this project at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/), I developed functions for acquiring and organizing information from a zoo, such as species on display, opening hours, and employee relations.
I used the knowledge acquired from JavaScript ES6 and HOFs (Higher Orders Functions), and developed tests using Jest.


## Lessons Learned

With this project, I developed my skills in working with arrays and objects, and how to manipulate them in order to extract new structures with the necessary information for each requirement.
